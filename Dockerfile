# Why Use daemon off; in Docker?
# By default, Nginx runs as a background (daemon) process, which means:
# It starts, Runs in the background, Then exits inside a Docker container.
# But Docker containers expect the main process (PID 1) to keep running in the foregroundâ€”otherwise, the container stops immediately after starting.
# So, setting daemon off; ensures that Nginx keeps running inside Docker.
# This is especially important for production environments, where you want the container to keep running even after the initial process has finished.
